# Damaged Roof Detection 
A system that can evaluate the integrity of a roof. 

## Why is this important? 
Broken roof tiles can pose a serious safety hazard in Florida, particularly during hurricane season when strong winds and heavy rains are common. Florida's climate and location make it especially vulnerable to hurricanes and other severe weather events, and a damaged roof can exacerbate the damage caused by these natural disasters. Broken tiles can allow water to penetrate the roof and cause leaks, which can lead to water damage and mold growth. In addition, loose or missing tiles can become projectiles during high winds, endangering nearby people and property. Therefore, it is essential to address broken roof tiles promptly to ensure the safety and integrity of your home or building.

## Who can benefit from a system like this? 
One of the main groups that will be able to benefit from a system like this would be home insurance companies. One of the main things they keep an eye on is the integrity of a roof on a house. Insurance companies already use drones to inspect roofs, so if they were able to have a system that could detect a broken roof tile/shingle and flag it immediately it would cut out the middle man of later having to inspect footage of the drone flying over the house. This would then be beneficial to the construction companies who have to do the repairs. They would know exactly what to fix and where it is located.
