### What is AlexNet? :computer: 
AlexNet is a Convolutional Neural Network Architecture that consists of 8 layers: 5 Convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. It is a pretrained network that is able to classify images into 1000 different categories. You are able to download a pretrained version of it. This is how I was able to train the AlexNet model to my own data set. 

## What is the goal of this system? :house:
The goal of this system is for it to be able to detect any cracks, holes, missing tiles, discoloration, ect in the roof of a house. This system would be used for just regualar maintenance checkups or with the intention to start repairs.

## Why is this important? 
Broken roof tiles can pose a serious safety hazard in Florida, particularly during hurricane season when strong winds and heavy rains are common. Florida's climate and location make it especially vulnerable to hurricanes and other severe weather events, and a damaged roof can exacerbate the damage caused by these natural disasters. Broken tiles can allow water to penetrate the roof and cause leaks, which can lead to water damage and mold growth. In addition, loose or missing tiles can become projectiles during high winds, endangering nearby people and property. Therefore, it is essential to address broken roof tiles promptly to ensure the safety and integrity of your home or building.

## Who can benefit from a system like this? 
One of the main groups that will be able to benefit from a system like this would be home insurance companies. One of the main things they keep an eye on is the integrity of a roof on a house. Insurance companies already use drones to inspect roofs, so if they were able to have a system that could detect a broken roof tile/shingle and flag it immediately it would cut out the middle man of later having to inspect footage of the drone flying over the house. This would then be beneficial to the construction companies who have to do the repairs. They would know exactly what to fix and where it is located. 

## What data will the AlexNet be trained with? 
There will be two categories for this trained system. One classifier will be "Damaged Roof" and the other will be "Good Condition Roof". For the damaged roof category I have used images of roofs with both tiles and shingles of different colors. All of these images will have some type of damage to the roof such as, ripped shingles, holes in the roof, broken tiles, missing tiles, missing shingles and water damage. For the roofs in good condition I have used images of roofs with tiles and shingles with no damage. They consist of different angles and all different types of roofs.
